## Project Overview

AdUARX is a mobile augmented reality (AR) application developed to enhance navigation within Adamson University. The application addresses common navigation challenges on campus by leveraging AR technology to provide an immersive and user-friendly experience. Key features of AdUARX include precise navigation capabilities, advanced pathfinding algorithms, and an intuitive interface designed for efficiency.

The project integrates the A* algorithm for pathfinding, offering a comparative analysis with the Dijkstra algorithm to evaluate performance differences. Through this approach, AdUARX demonstrates effective accuracy and user engagement, showcasing its potential to revolutionize navigation solutions in educational environments.
